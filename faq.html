									<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
								</header>

								<h3>Where can I find new patient forms?</h3>
								<p>When you first arrive and meet our staff, youâ€™ll fill out your new patient paperwork. This helps our team get to know you better. We ask that you arrive 15 minutes early to complete your paperwork. Or, you can get a head start by filling out your patient forms now. <a href="images/painquestionnaire.pdf" download>Download New Patient Forms</a>.</p>

								<h3>Does Dr. Reid prescribe narcotic medications for pain?</h3>
								<p>No, here at Sebring Pain Management, Dr. Reid does not prescribe narcotic medications. Dr. Reid uses interventional approaches, such as injections, to diagnose and treat painful conditions.</p>

								<h3>Why do I need to bring a driver?</h3>
								<p>When appropriate, procedures will be performed under sedation. This may cause numbness, weakness and decreased movement in parts of your body that would make it unsafe for you to drive. Recovery time from sedation affects everyone differently and we require you to follow instructions that are provided for your safety.</p>

								<h3>Can I take my medications before a scheduled procedure?</h3>
								<p>You may take your daily maintenance medications, such as heart, blood pressure, or thyroid medicines prior to your appointment. However, so Dr. Reid may properly evaluate your pain symptoms, we recommend you do not take your pain medicines prior to your appointment.</p>

								<h3>Can I eat or drink before my appointment?</h3>
								<p>When appropriate, procedures will be performed under sedation. Your bodyâ€™s reflexes are temporarily slowed during sedation. If your stomach has food and drink in it, thereâ€™s a risk of vomiting or aspiration. To prevent nausea and vomiting, we require you to not eat or drink 6 hours prior to your appointment. (Only small sips of water are allowed to be taken with your heart or blood pressure medicines the morning of your procedure.)</p>

								<h3>Will I be asleep for the procedure?</h3>
								<p>Intravenous sedation is available for most, but not all procedures. Intravenous conscious sedation will not guarantee that everyone will sleep through their procedure; it is ultimately provided for comfort and relaxation during procedures.</p>

								<h3>When can I remove my bandage?</h3>
								<p>A bandage is placed at the injection site immediately after your procedure is completed to stop bleeding and prevent infection. You may remove your bandage when you get home prior to bathing.</p>

								<h3>When can I exercise or return to my normal activities?</h3>
								<p>You may return to exercise or your normal activity 24 hours after your procedure or once any discomfort from the injection is gone. Pace yourself in the days to follow.</p>

								<h3>Will I have pain after an injection? What can I do for the pain?</h3>
								<p>Yes, it is normal to have soreness or discomfort at the injection site after your procedure. Common symptoms after an injection include soreness, aching, or stiffness. Everyone experiences pain differently. To decrease discomfort, apply ice packs 15 minutes every hour, for 24 hours while awake. DO NOT use heat for 2-3 days after your injection. You may take over-the-counter medicines like Tylenol, Motrin or Aleve for inflammation and pain if needed. Call the office if you experience symptoms such as a fever over 101Â°F, severe headache, severe nausea and vomiting, or discomfort that becomes severe or interferes with movement that you havenâ€™t experienced before.</p>
